                <h3>From the novels of old fantasy, until the modern storytelling of fantasy today, many people until now are fasccinated by the concept of dwarves in the world. They are mostly known from movies like gimli from lord of the rings to games like The Deep Rock Galactic. More often than not, with their stature, most who see them would just call them smaller, stubbier humans, of which they are terribly mistaken. This website is aimed towards those in need of inspiration of what a dwarf is and should be. In roleplaying games like Dungeons And Dragons, Pathfinder, to even just writing stories about dwarves, It's important to represent this species that have been cultivated from the great minds of others and give proper light to their traits.</h3>
